## Lesson 2 Breakdown:
### What is the purpose of financial institutions?
Financial institutions, also known as banking institutions, are institutions (public or private) that collects funds (from the public or other institutions) and **invest them in, or spends them on,** financial assets.
Their primary and most useful function is to act as an **intermediary, or a link,** between consumers and money markets by providing wealth management services.

### How to identify different types?
There are generally 2 types of financial institutions: depository and non-depository.
1. **Depository Institutions** accepts and manages monetary deposits. They also provide loans. 
2. **Non-Depository Institutions** serves as a link between savers and borrowers, but cannot legally accept regular monetary deposits. Instead, they combine payments or contributions of many people in the form of **premiums (contractual payments)** and either invest it or provide credit to others.
We will discuss non-depository institutions in Lesson 6. For now, let's focus on depository institutions and their role in society today.

### Depository Institutions:
As stated before, depository institutions are institutions that accept money, manage deposits, and provide loans. 
Examples of these type of institutions include, but are not limited to:

**Commercial and Savings Banks**- financial institutions, insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and governed by federal and state laws and regulations, whose primary purpose is offering traditional financial products and services like: making loans, paying checks, accepting deposits, and providing other financial services to the general public and to companies. Banks can be anywhere, like at your local grocery store or down the street from your home, and they can be big or small.

**Marketplace Lending or Peer-to-Peer Lending Platforms (P2P)**- are financial corporations, regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), whose primary purpose is to enable individuals to obtain loans directly from other individuals, cutting out the financial institution as the middleman; an alternative method to financing. Some examples of P2P institutions include, but is not limited to:
- *PayPal*, an American company operating a worldwide online payments system, supports online money transfers and serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods like checks and money orders. They also provide loans.
- *Cash App*, a mobile payment service developed by Square, Inc., allows users to transfer money to one another using a mobile phone app. It also allows their users to purchase and sell Bitcoins.

### Why is it important to know?
This is important to know because financial institutions play a critical role in wealth management. 
1. It allows for convenience and a peace of mind knowing the exact location of your money. Plus, instead of carrying around pockets and bags of money, you could swipe your card or tap your phone when making purchases or withdrawing funds. 
2. Banking with financial institutions is actually safer than carrying cash on hand since they're regulated by the government. Money could easily be lost, stolen, or even destroyed if you hang on to it, but when properly utilizing these institutions, your assets are protected. Meaning even if something did happen with that institution, you're still protected by the FDIC (up to $250,000). 
3. Using financial institutions allow individuals opportunities to make financially sound decisions. They also have experts and advisors you to assist you in your decision making.
