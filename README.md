## Lesson 2 Breakdown:
### What are Financial Institutions? (1 good suggestion, 2 medium suggestions)
Financial institutions, also known as banks, are institutions that collects funds (from the public or other financial institutions) and **invest** them in, *or spends them on,* financial assets.
- These institutions can be Public or Private
- Meaning you can go down the street and see one on the corner, you can go inside of a grocery store and possibly see a bank in there, or you may pass by one on corner and won't even recognize because of its exclusivity or privacy, basically.

### Why do you think we would need to use a Financial Institution for our money? (3 suggestions)
The primary and most useful function of these financial institutions is to act as an **intermediary**, *or a link,* between us, the consumers, and money markets, or other financial institutions. Each type of Financial Institution does this through providing wealth management services.

### Let's go over some types of Financial Institutions and their functions:
1. Central Banks 
- In the U.s., that would be the Federal Reserve Bank, which is responsible for conducting regulations of other financial institutions.
- Individual consumers like you and I would not have direct contact with FRB.
- Larger FIs work directly with FRB to provide Ps and Ss to the general public.

2. Retail and Commercial Banks
- Work directly with individual consumers and businesses.
- They offer ps and ss like:
1. Checking/Savings Deposit Accounts
2. Business Banking Accounts
3. Personal/Mortgage Loans
4. Credit Cards (Only acquire one of these to build your credit, do not acquire one of these for personal reasons.)
5. Assets to Invest in (Like CDs, Certificate of Deposit)

3. Credit Unions
- Similar to retail banks
- Some are more exclusive than others, but all serve a specific demographic (like teachers, military, etc.) and operate for their benefit.

4. Savings and Loan Associations
- For Individual Consumers to acquire savings deposit accounts, personal loans, and mortgage lending.

5. Investment Banks and Companies
- Commonly known as mutual fund companies
- Do not take deposits of any kind, instead you can raise capital through acquiring securities.
- Pool money from consumers and investors and give them access to a broad securities market.
- Most people select to use mutual funds with their 401k which always them to split up their investments into different markets.

6. Brokerage Firms
- Assist individuals and institutions in buying/selling securities amongst available investors.
- Trade Securities
1. Stocks
2. Bonds
3. Mutual Funds

7. Insurance Companies
- They help individuals transfer risk of loss
- Individuals and businesses use insurance companies to protect against financial loss due to death, disability, accidents, property damage, and other misfortunes.

8. Mortgage Companies
- Financial institutions that originate or fund mortgage loans
- While most mortgage companies serve the individual consumer market, some specialize in lending options for commercial real estate only.

9. Internet Banks (Fairly new style of banking)
- Similar to retail banks
- They offer ps and ss like:
1. Checking/Savings Deposit Accounts
2. Business Banking Accounts
3. Personal/Mortgage Loans
4. Credit Cards
- No physical location

### PayPal & Cash App
Today new companies, like PayPal and Cash App, are on the rise and are slowing easing their way into the banking world.
Although neither PayPal nor Cash App is considered to be physical "banks", they are considered to be prominent financial payment systems in today's society that you need to know about.

- *PayPal* is an American company operating a worldwide online payments system. 
1. It supports online money transfers
2. Provide electronic alternative to traditional paper methods like checks and money orders. 
3. They also provide personal and business loans and are slowly integrating into a future regulated financial institution.

- *Cash App* is a mobile payment system developed by Square, Inc., which allows users to transfer money to one another using a mobile phone app. 
1. They offer their own debit card to users to conduct transactions in stores or atms.
2. It allows their users to purchase and sell Bitcoins, a form of cryptocurrency as mentioned in Lesson 1.

These aren't the only new financial systems on the rise either. Other financial payment systems like VenMo and Zelle are also partnering with banks to create new financial institutions

The primary purpose of these new systems is to enable individuals to obtain loans directly from other individuals, thus cutting out the financial institution as the middleman; an alternative method to financing. 

### Why is this important to know?
It is important to know about financial institutions because they play a major role in wealth management. Knowing the difference will allow you to make sensible decisions for your financial needs.
1. Banks and payment system allows for convenience and a peace of mind knowing the exact location of your money. Plus, instead of carrying around pockets and bags of money, you could swipe your card or tap your phone when making purchases or withdrawing funds. 
2. Also, using financial institutions allow individuals opportunities to make financially sound decisions. They have experts and advisors ready you to assist you in your decision making.
2. Internet banking allow for funds to be transfered and available in your account immediately, while banks make between $100-$250 available to you until the rest of funds deposited are cleared. This process usually takes 1-2 business days.
2. Banking with financial institutions is actually safer than using Internet Banks though since they're regulated by the government and backed by law. If something did happen with that institution, your assets are protected by the FDIC (up to $250,000).
