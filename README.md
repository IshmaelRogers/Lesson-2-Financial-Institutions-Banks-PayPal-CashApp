## Lesson 2 Breakdown:
### Purpose of Financial Institutions:
Financial institutions, also known as banking institutions, are institutions (public or private) that collects funds (from the public or other institutions) and **invest them in, or spends them on,** financial assets.
Their primary and most useful function is to act as an **intermediary, or a link,** between consumers and money markets by providing wealth management services.

### Types of Financial Institutions:
There are generally 2 types of financial institutions: depository and non-depository.
1. **Depository Institutions** accepts and manages monetary deposits and provide loans. Examples of these type of institutions include, but are not limited to:

- ***Commercial and Savings Banks***
- These financial institutions are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and governed by federal and state laws and regulations.
- Their primary purpose is offering traditional financial products and services like: making loans, paying checks, accepting deposits, and providing other financial services to the general public and companies. 
- Banks can be located anywhere, like at your local grocery store or down the street from your home, and they can be big or small.

2. **Non-Depository Institutions** serves as a link between savers and borrowers, but cannot legally accept regular monetary deposits. Instead, they combine payments or contributions of many people in the form of **premiums (contractual payments)** and either invest it or provide credit to others. Examples of these institutions include, but are not limited to: insurance companies, mutual funds, and finance companies.

We will discuss non-depository institutions in Lesson 6. 

### Payment Systems:
Today new companies, like PayPal and Cash App, are on the rise and are slowing easing their way into the banking world.
Although neither PayPal nor Cash App is considered to be actual "banks", they are considered to be prominent financial payment systems in today's society that you need to know about.
- *PayPal* is an American company operating a worldwide online payments system. It supports online money transfers and serves as an electronic alternative to traditional paper methods like checks and money orders. They also provide personal and business loans and are slowly integrating into a future regulated financial institution.
- *Cash App* is a mobile payment system developed by Square, Inc., allows users to transfer money to one another using a mobile phone app. It also allows their users to purchase and sell Bitcoins, a form of cryptocurrency as mentioned in Lesson 1.

These aren't the only new financial systems on the rise either. Other financial payment systems like VenMo and Zelle are also partnering with banks to create new financial institutions.
The primary purpose of these new systems is to enable individuals to obtain loans directly from other individuals, thus cutting out the financial institution as the middleman; an alternative method to financing. 

### Why is this important to know?
It is important to know about financial institutions and payment system because they play a major role in wealth management. Knowing the difference will allow you to make sensible decisions for your financial needs.
1. Banks and payment system allows for convenience and a peace of mind knowing the exact location of your money. Plus, instead of carrying around pockets and bags of money, you could swipe your card or tap your phone when making purchases or withdrawing funds. 
2. Payment systems allow for funds to be transfered and available in your account immediately, while banks make between $100-$250 available to you until the rest of funds deposited are cleared. This process usually takes 1-2 business days.
2. Banking with financial institutions is actually safer than using payment systems, for the moment, since they're regulated by the government and backed by law. If something did happen with that institution, your assets are protected by the FDIC (up to $250,000). 
3. Also, using financial institutions allow individuals opportunities to make financially sound decisions. They have experts and advisors ready you to assist you in your decision making.
