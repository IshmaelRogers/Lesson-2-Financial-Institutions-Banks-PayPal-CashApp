## Lesson 2 Breakdown:
### What is the purpose of financial institutions?
- Financial institutions are institutions (public or private) that collects funds (from the public or other institutions) and **invest them in, or spends them on,** financial assets.
- Their primary and most useful function is to act as an **intermediary, or a link,** between consumers and capital or debt markets by providing banking and investment services.

### How to identify different types?
- There are generally 2 types of financial institutions: depository and non-depository.
1. **Depository Institutions**- institutions that accepts and manages monetary deposits. They also provide loans. 
2. **Non-Depository Institutions**- institutions that serves as a link between savers and borrowers, but cannot legally accept regular monetary deposits. Instead, they combine payments or contributions of many people in the form of **premiums (contractual payments)** and either invest it or provide credit to others.
- We will discuss non-depository institutions in Lesson 6. For now, let's focus on depository institutions and their role in society today.

- Examples of these type of institutions include, but are not limited to:
